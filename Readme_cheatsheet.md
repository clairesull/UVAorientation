## Markdown notation cheat sheet
* one '#' makes something a title 
* two '##' makes something a subtitle
* '**' makes something **bold**
* '*' makes something *italic*
* '*', '-' or '+' is also used as bullet points
* add spaces before a bullet point until the list character is directly under the first letter of the list item for a sublist
  * this is a sublist 
* to link something put in the formant of '[text]''(link)'
* to create a task, make a list with '-', followed by '[]', a completex task is '[x]'
  * example:
    - [ ] graduate
    - [x] complete techinal orientation
